    // 6. After fixing number 5, write a print statement to print the number
    // of cats and dogs using the variables, like:
    // There are 2 cats and 4 dogs

    // 7. Write a when statement that prints whether there are more cats than 
    // dogs, more dogs than cats, are there are the same number of each.
    // Hint: you can simply do 
    //     when {...}
    // and compare variables for each condition

    // 8. Use a when statement to determine if a character is a vowel or 
    // consonant and print the result. Char has methods named lowercaseChar()
    // and uppercaseChar() you can use, or you can assume upper/lowercase
    // Hint: you can create a listOf vowels

    // 9. Use a for loop to print the numbers 0 to 9 in reverse order. Hint -
    // there is a downTo keyword

    // 10. Create one list with 3 of your favorite shows/movies/games/etc. and
    // print the list

    // 11. Create another list with 2 or 3 of your least favorite shows/movies/
    // /games/etc. Then, create a third list that contains everything from both lists.
    // Print out this new list.


    // 12. Remove your most and least favorite from the combined list, and print
    // this new list. (You may need to modify what you did for 10 and 11)

    // 13. Create a string variable and set it to null, then print the string

    // 14. Make a variable and set it to the length of the string from problem 13 such 
    // that if the string is null, the variable will be -1, then print the length.

    // 15. Write a when statement that returns a string saying if the string
    // is empty, the string is short, the string is medium length, or the string
    // is long. Whatever you consider is short, medium, and long is fine.
